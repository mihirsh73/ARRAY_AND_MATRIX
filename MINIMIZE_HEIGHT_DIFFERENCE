iven an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K.

For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.

Increase the height of the tower by K.
Decrease the height of the tower by K ( you can do this operation only if the height of the tower is greater than or equal to K)
Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower.
int getMinDiff(int arr[], int n, int k) {
        
        sort(arr,arr+n);
        int min_height,max_height;
        
        int ans= arr[n-1]-arr[0];
        for(int i=1; i<n; i++)
        {
            if(arr[i]-k<0)
            {
                continue;
            }
            min_height= min(arr[0]+k,arr[i]-k);
            max_height = max(arr[n-1]-k, arr[i-1]+k);  // tc o(n(log(n))
            ans = min(ans,max_height-min_height);
        }
        return ans;
    }
